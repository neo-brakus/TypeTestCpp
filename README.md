## 🚀 TypeTest++ - C++ Typing Practice

➡️ **Live Demo:** [neo-brakus.github.io/TypeTestCpp](https://neo-brakus.github.io/TypeTestCpp/)

🛠️ This project is built using **React**.  
⌨️ It's a typing test that generates random **C++ syntax** for you to practice typing speed and accuracy.  

🧠 If you enable the **"Expressions"** option, you'll get randomized expressions using commonly seen variable names.

🧪 Great for practicing:
- C++ keywords
- Code structure
- Typing speed under pressure

---

✨ Give it a try and see how fast you can type real-looking C++ code!
